Excellent clear and correct code.

You should have a .gitignore file. 

Comments on file frame3_cos_bell.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The doc-string to the function main_cos_bell should describe all the arguments to the function, any arguments and what is created by the function (ie plots and data tables).

    You use the number 0.75 twice so this should be defined as a variable.

    You need to change the argument to the function
    plt.legend
    so that the legend shows.
    Type 
    help(plt.legend)
    in python to see how to use this command (after you have done 
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)

There is a lot of code duplication between files frame3_cos_bell.py and frame3_mixed.py. In fact only 7 of the 88 lines differ. 

Same comment goes for frame3_square.py

Same comment for frameCTCS.py, frameFTBS.py and frameLW.pyplot

Function CTCS creates storage for 3 new arrays - phi, phi1 and phi2. You only need 2 new arrays because you can use phiOld (like you do in FTBS and like I did in FTCS).

You are using some of my functions and files so no need to rename them.
